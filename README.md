# COVID-19 Singapore Visualisation

While stuck at home during Circuit Breaker, I decided to build some visualisations of the situation! 

## User Guide: Visualise!
This project is not hosted on the web at the moment as I am a poor fresh grad who can't afford to host things. However, you can build and run it in your local machine by doing the following:

1. Clone this project
2. Run the following to install dependencies
    ```
    yarn
    ```
3. Run the following to start the visualisation in localhost
    ```
    yarn start
    ```
